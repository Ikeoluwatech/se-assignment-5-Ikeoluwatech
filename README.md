3. Editor Area:
The main workspace where you edit your files.
You can open multiple editors side by side vertically or horizontally.
Each editor displays the content of an open file.
Primary Side Bar:
Contains various views to assist you while working on your project.
Common views include the Explorer (for file navigation), Search, Source Control (Git), Debug, and Extensions.
Status Bar:
Located at the bottom of the window.
Provides information about the currently opened project and the files you’re editing.
Displays helpful indicators, such as line and column numbers, language mode, and Git branch status.
Activity Bar:
Located on the far left-hand side.
Allows you to switch between different views quickly.
Includes icons for Explorer, Search, Source Control, Debug, and Extensions.
Context-specific indicators appear here (e.g., Git changes).
Panel:
Located below the editor region.
Contains additional views like output, debug information, errors, warnings, and an integrated terminal.
You can move the panel to the left or right for more vertical space.

4. Keyboard Shortcut:
Press Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (Mac).
This opens the Command Palette, where you can start typing to search for a specific command.
Menu Option:
Click on View in the application menu.
Select Command Palette from the dropdown.
Common tasks you can perform using the Command Palette include:

Running commands (e.g., opening files, formatting code, running tasks).
Changing settings (e.g., configuring extensions, adjusting editor behavior).
Installing and managing extensions.
Searching for specific actions or features.

5. Finding Extensions:

After installation, the button changes to Manage.
For example, consider the following essential extensions:
JavaScript (ES6) Code Snippets: Provides code snippets for JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue, React, and HTML. A must-have for web development1
CSS Peek: Allows you to jump to CSS code using classes and IDs2
Auto Close Tag: Automatically adds closing tags for HTML and XML3
REST Client: Test APIs directly in VS Code without external tools4
ESLint: Linting utility for JavaScript. Validates your code while you write it.

Click the Run and Debug icon or use ⇧⌘D (Windows/Linux: Ctrl+Shift+D).
Launch Configurations:
Create a launch.json file (if needed) with configuration details.
Debugging Features:
